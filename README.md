College Work Projects


Here I have pushed various projects I have completed in the past. Most, if not all, are from different classes I took while pursuing my Computer Engineering degree at The University of Illinois at Chicago.

Project: Cache Simulator
Description:
	This project was completed for my advanced computer architecture class. We were given a cache design, with various upgrade options. Our task was to find the quickest cache configuration and explain why. Our benchmarks were the use of 5 commonly used utilities, namely: gcc, gzip, mcc, swim, twolf. I created the cache simulator in java, and used command line to run the program in various configurations and with different cache traces. The cache traces, raw results, tables, and report are included with the Java class in the folder.
